  x,
  cellsize = 10,
  nmin_cell = 4,
  n_p = 1000,

\arguments{
\item{data}{an \code{sf} object with projected coordinates. If the object
geometries are in geographical coordinates, a valid \code{crs} must be specified.}

\item{y}{character of length 1; specifying \code{data} column name containing
(numeric) response variable.}

\item{x}{character of length 1; specifying \code{data} column name containing
(character or factor) classification variable (treatments to compare).}

\item{cellsize}{numeric of length 1 or 2 with target cell size. Argument
passed to \code{\link[sf]{st_make_grid}}.}

\item{nmin_cell}{numeric of length 1; specifying minimum number of data points
that accommodate each grid cell.}

\item{n_p}{numeric positive value specifying the number of permutations.}

\item{n_s}{numeric positive value specifying the number of random
samples of grid cells to carry out perumational ANOVAs.}

\item{alpha}{numeric of length 1, alpha value (between 0 and 1) for meant test.}

\item{shift}{numeric of length 1 or 2; specifying shift from lower.
left corner coordinates (x, y) of \code{data}.}

\item{alpha_bonferroni}{logical specifying if p-value must be adjusted using
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.}

\item{crs}{coordinate reference system: integer with the EPSG code,
or character with proj4string to convert coordinates if \code{data} has
longitude/latitude data.}

\item{...}{additional argument for \code{\link[sf]{st_make_grid}}.}
}
\value{
a list of length 4 with mean test comparisson results

\description{
Approach to statistically analyze unreplicated OFE to promote field-specific
inference of treatment effects. Statistical tools for spatial data are
coupled with permutation tests to determine the statistical significance
between treatment means.
}
\details{
The methodology involves:
\enumerate{
  \item calculation of effective sample size (ESS) given the underlying spatial
structure.
  \item ANOVA permutation test on a random sample of ESS.
  \item generation of the empirical distribution of p-values from repetition of
step two. The median of this empirical distribution is regarded as the
p-value associated with the non-treatment effect hypothesis.
}
The test can be easily extended to cover scenarios with more than two
treatments by employing pairwise comparisons of OFE across multiple
treatments, with p-values can be adjusted for multiplicity
using Bonferroni correction
